Continuous Integration
======================

Clickable CI Docker Images
--------------------------

Two docker images are available for easily using Clickable with a continuous
integration setup. They can be found on Docker hub: ``clickable/ci-16.04-armhf``
and ``clickable/ci-16.04-amd64``. The images come with Clickable pre installed
and already setup in container mode.
